            <h2>Air Rifle:</h2>
            <p>As in any sport, the sporting equipment forms the basis for your success. For sport
                shooting with an air rifle, it is important to make sure that the settings of the
                rifle can be individually adjusted to you. In order to adjust the rifle to your
                needs, it is very helpful to have a second person look at your stand from the
                outside and take photos for adjustment. At school and youth level, you can also
                shoot three-position disciplines with the air rifle. In this case, you should make
                sure that the conversion is as simple and quick as possible. Be sure to make a note
                of the conversion settings in the shoot report master data function so that you
                always have them at hand.</p>

            <h3>TIP:</h3>
            <p>The high-end air rifle model "800 X" from Feinwerkbau is considered an all-rounder
                rifle in terms of settings for the shooter. In terms of shooting performance,
                quality, functionality and design, this match rifle is in the absolute top class.
                Visually, the 800 X corresponds to the typically distinctive Feinwerkbau line with
                its shapely design.</p>

            <p>In the field of small-bore match rifles, one model in particular is recommended: "Alu
                2800" from Feinwerkbau. With its aluminium stock, the small-bore rifle "2800 Alu"
                offers you many adjustment options so that you can quickly and easily adapt the
                rifle to your needs. With the damper you can adjust the shooting behaviour even more
                to your needs. In addition, the loading window of the revolutionary precision bolt
                has been moved significantly to the rear to create even more comfort for the
                shooter, which is a significant advantage for three-position combat.</p>

            <p>Feinwerkbau has developed the "2800 Alu X-Change" model variant especially for the

                rear stock unit with grip, cheek piece and butt plate can be detached in one piece.
                When changing the shooting position, another unit with correspondingly preset stock 
                components can be mounted in a flash and the preparation time in the final can be

            <p>In addition to purchasing a new small-bore rifle, there is the possibility of
                upgrading your system with an interchangeable stock. Upgrading your stock often
                offers you many possibilities in your individual settings with your usual system.
                When choosing your rifle stock, make sure that you can adjust all settings
                individually and that you feel comfortable with the new stock. Be sure to make a

                in three-position combat. The possibility of integrating almost any system into this

           <h2>Shooting range:</h2>
            <p>With your ideal sports equipment you should use optimal conditions at the shooting range. 
               In addition to good lighting, the shooting range is a key factor here. Whether you use a 
               target pull system or an electronic system with digital score display, setting up on the 
               target is an important step in your process. 
            </p>
            <p>Modern shooting systems with digital score 
               displays offer you as a shooter an absolute added value. Only a short time after firing, 
               you can see your precisely evaluated shot on your tablet or monitor in tenths of a second. 
               This is helpful if you want to immediately compare your feeling at the moment of firing 
               with the result you have achieved in order to get into a "flow" or if you want to carry 
               out stop corrections. However, pay attention to your post-target phase with every shot. 
               You should do this very carefully, especially with a digital scoreboard.
            </p>
            <p>Also in competition, the systems, with the extrapolation function and the visualisation 
               on the shooting range and in the guest room, offer a lot of fun and exciting moments for 
               you and all your audience. For training, both in the youth and adult sector, electronic 
               systems offer interesting variants of fun targets, which are excellently suited as a 
               change to mirror training and make club events an absolute highlight.

            <p>The "OpticScore" system from DISAG offers you the fastest possible, precise and reliable 
               evaluations in the field of non-contact, optical shot detection. With the light of numerous 
               infrared light-emitting diodes and a specially developed lens, a measuring light curtain is 
               created that is invisible to your eye. The bullet is detected and registered by two high-speed 
               sensors when it passes through the measuring light curtain. Certified by the DSB for its 
               precision and functionality, this system for distances of 10 (rifle/pistol), 15 (Zimmerstutzen) 
               or 50 meters (rifle) is thus ideally suited for shooting sports according to the most modern standards.

           <h2>Shooting range:</h2>
            <p>With your ideal sports equipment you should use optimal conditions at the shooting range. 
               In addition to good lighting, the shooting range is a key factor here. Whether you use a 
               target pull system or an electronic system with digital score display, setting up on the 
               target is an important step in your process. 
  	    </p>
	    <p>Modern shooting systems with digital score 
               displays offer you as a shooter an absolute added value. Only a short time after firing, 
               you can see your precisely evaluated shot on your tablet or monitor in tenths of a second. 
               This is helpful if you want to immediately compare your feeling at the moment of firing 
               with the result you have achieved in order to get into a "flow" or if you want to carry 
               out stop corrections. However, pay attention to your post-target phase with every shot. 
               You should do this very carefully, especially with a digital scoreboard.
   	    </p>
	    <p>Also in competition, the systems, with the extrapolation function and the visualisation 
               on the shooting range and in the guest room, offer a lot of fun and exciting moments for 
               you and all your audience. For training, both in the youth and adult sector, electronic 
               systems offer interesting variants of fun targets, which are excellently suited as a 
               change to mirror training and make club events an absolute highlight.

            <h3>TIP:</h3>
            <p>The "OpticScore" system from DISAG offers you the fastest possible, precise and reliable 
               evaluations in the field of non-contact, optical shot detection. With the light of numerous 
               infrared light-emitting diodes and a specially developed lens, a measuring light curtain is 
               created that is invisible to your eye. The bullet is detected and registered by two high-speed 
               sensors when it passes through the measuring light curtain. This makes this system ideal for 
               distances of 10, 15 or 50 metres.
            </p>
            <p>Many other features such as target image changer, integrated traffic light system and 
               multi-coloured LED illumination are also available. With many different fun and lucky targets, 
               DISAG offers you an absolute novelty on the market for shooting systems with digital hit display.

            <h2>Light Pistol:</h2>
            <p>To gain initial experience in sport shooting, there is the possibility of light
                shooting. The special feature: children under the age of 12 are allowed to train
                with the light rifle without special permission. Since all the movements are the
                same as in sport shooting with the air pistol, this is a great added value for the
                youngsters - and not only for shooting clubs.</p>

            <h3>TIP:</h3>
            <p>With a unique laser technology, the manufacturer Feinwerkbau offers a simulator
                pistol for light shooting for all sport shooters under the age of 12. The light
                pistol is suitable for both right-handed and left-handed shooters and offers many
                setting options to introduce children to the sport in the best possible way. No
                compromises have been made in the components used. Especially when working with
                young people, it is important to train with high-quality components right from the
                start - for example, a full-fledged match trigger was built into this light
                pistol.</p>
